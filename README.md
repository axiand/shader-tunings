# What are these?
These are tunings for Minecraft shaders. I made these for my personal use, but I've uploaded them here so that you too can use them.

# Explain your naming process
I call them tunings because it sounded cool. You can call them settings, or configs, because that's basically what they are.

# Can I use them?
Sure! These tunings are released into the public domain. It means you can use them commercially or for personal use. You can also modify them and redistribute them. However, it would be nice if you could pay me with exposure and credit me when using them in your own work (e.g. a video, screenshot, or modified version).

# Word of note
These tunings are set up in such a way where caves and unlit areas are pitch-black. While this is good for cinematic shots, it might be bad for regular gameplay unless you have lots of torches on you.

# Installation
Download whichever tunings you want. Open settings > video settings > shader packs > [whichever pack the tuning uses] > shader pack settings. Then, finally, locate and click the Import settings button. It looks like a download icon. Select the tuning file you downloaded, and you're all set.

# List of Tunings

## Gentle
Shader: [Complementary](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/customization/complementary-shaders)

Made to be lifelike, with colors that let your eyes rest while also not being boring. This one's the perfect choice if you want a realistic look without too much exaggeration. It's also my personal favourite.

## Bright Day
Shader: [Complementary](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/customization/complementary-shaders)

This one makes the colors pop. It's saturated and bright, making it a good pick for colorful, vibrant scenes.

## Dreamy Tone
Shader: [Complementary](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/customization/complementary-shaders)

Like looking at the world through a pair of rose-tinted glasses, this tuning is fit for those aesthetic scenes.
Note: This tuning makes the nights almost completely dark.

## Dreamy Tone Alt
Shader: [Complementary](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/customization/complementary-shaders)

A brighter, slightly less rose-tinted version of Dreamy Tone. Good for aesthetic-but-slightly-less scenes.

## Overcast
Shader: [Complementary](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/customization/complementary-shaders)

A highly desaturated, bleak tuning for grim scenes. That or winter scenes.

## Summer Day
Shader: [Complementary](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/customization/complementary-shaders)

Bask in the golden sunlight with this warm tuning. Featuring semi-saturated warm colors throughout the whole day. Caution: hot!

## Vibrance
Shader: [Complementary](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/customization/complementary-shaders)

This tuning is pretty much the default settings of Complementary but adjusted for myself. Vibrant tones, sunrays and bright daytime galore.
